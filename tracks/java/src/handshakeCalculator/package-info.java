/**
 * Provides classes and enums for calculating a sequence of handshake signals.
 *
 * This package includes:
 * - HandshakeCalculator: A class that calculates a series of handshake signals
 * based on a given integer.
 * The calculation is done by interpreting the binary representation of the
 * integer, where each bit corresponds
 * to a specific handshake signal.
 * - Signal: An enum representing the various signals used in a handshake
 * sequence, such as WINK, DOUBLE_BLINK,
 * CLOSE_YOUR_EYES, and JUMP.
 *
 * The package is designed to interpret numerical values as sequences of
 * handshake signals, useful in scenarios
 * where a non-verbal, gesture-based communication system is implemented.
