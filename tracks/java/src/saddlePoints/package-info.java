/**
 * Provides classes for identifying and handling saddle points in matrices.
 * 
 * A saddle point in a matrix is defined as an element that is the minimum in
 * its row and the maximum in its column.
 * This package contains the Matrix class which is used to find saddle points
 * within a given matrix of integers,
 * and the MatrixCoordinate class which represents the coordinates of a saddle
 * point.
 * 
 * The Matrix class processes a list of lists of integers, identifying all
 * saddle points within the matrix.
 * Each saddle point is represented as a MatrixCoordinate object, which holds
 * the row and column indices of the point in the matrix.
 * 
 * This package is useful for mathematical and algorithmic operations involving
 * matrices.
