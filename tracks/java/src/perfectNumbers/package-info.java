/**
 * Provides the classes necessary to classify natural numbers as perfect, deficient, or abundant.
 * <p>
 * The {@code perfectNumbers} package includes the {@code NaturalNumber} class,
 * which represents a natural number and can classify it based on its aliquot sum.
 * The package also includes the {@code Classification} enum, which defines the
 * three possible classifications of natural numbers: perfect, deficient, and abundant.
 * <p>
 * A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
 * An abundant number has a sum of divisors greater than itself, and a deficient
 * number has a sum of divisors less than itself. This package provides the necessary
 * tools to perform these classifications.
