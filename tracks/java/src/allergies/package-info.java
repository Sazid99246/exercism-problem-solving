/**
 * Provides classes and enumerations for managing and assessing allergies.
 * <p>
 * This package includes the {@code Allergies} class, which allows for the creation of an allergy profile
 * based on a numeric score. It supports checking for allergic reactions to specific allergens
 * and retrieving a list of allergens that elicit reactions based on the allergy score.
 * <p>
 * The package also includes the {@code Allergen} enum, which defines various common allergens,
 * each associated with a unique score. These scores are used in conjunction with the {@code Allergies}
 * class to determine the presence of allergic reactions.
 * <p>
 * This package is useful in scenarios where allergy management and assessment are required,
 * such as in healthcare applications, dietary planning tools, and allergy tracking systems.
